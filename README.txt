Project name: Mana
Company name: New Albion Inc

Product description:
		Mana is a near-instant tutoring service that allows university students to connect with 
	high-quality tutors in their field. Through official partnerships with schools, Mana harnesses 
	universities’ communities to create a network of verified upper-year students as tutors, while
	creating a safe marketplace for students to find individual help on campus.

Additional details (summary):
	- Students can enter their search parameters into Mana when they request to find a tutor.
		- Parameters include but are not limited to: course/subject, length of session, price range, meeting location
		- All students have their identities verified through the university using their student number

	- Tutors are verified via student number, and through the university are confirmed as knowledgeable
		- Year of study and GPA for specific subjects are used to calculate 'Academic Rating' for tutors
		- Through university partnerships, tutors can be endorsed on their knowledge and soft skills by faculty members
			- As such, known TAs are likely to receive better Academic Ratings than other tutors

	- Tutors may set their own parameters, such as available hours, minimum session length, subjects
		- Tutor rates are based on an algorithm that combines Academic Ratings with user reviews.
			- User reviews are on a 5-point scale and can only be submitted in a short period after the session (no 1-star reviews because the student failed their test!)
			- Tutors may choose to lower their minimum rate in order to reach a wider range of students
	
	- When a student submits a request for a tutor, all tutors on-campus whose parameters comply with the student's request receive a notification
		- The first tutor to accept a student's request wins the session.
		- They are then instructed where on campus they need to go to meet their student.

	- Payment is automatic after the end of the session
